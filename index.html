				<h1>GIS for Society</h1>
				<h4>In March of 2014, as part of my bachelor’s degree, I took part in the course GIS for Society.
					This was one of my favorite courses. Ever. On this page I'll give an incomplete summary of the 
					interesting things I learned. 
					Last updated in August 2017.</h4>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="topheader"> <!-- General -->
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-12"><h2>In general</h2></div>
			</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row paragraph final">
				<div class="col-6">
					<p>With less than 20 participants, GIS for Society was a very personal and interactive course.
							Whilst most courses at the Wageningen University are very <i>green</i> and <i>nature-oriented</i>
							(which I see as a good thing, don't get me wrong), this course looked into the direct <b>application of GIS into modern society</b>.
							It was a very broad course, ranging from ArcMap applications (like network analysis) 
							to theoretical background on current GIS developments (like integration of personal GPS-data in Google Earth, 
							and comparison of open and closed source software). Due to its broad range of topics and the personal touch,
							and of course the exciting final assignment, this has so far been <b>my favourite course</b> at the Wageningen University. 
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-6">
					<p>Three parts of this course that I want to discuss are:
						<ol>
							<li><b>GreenRoads app</b> – in which we had to invent a GIS-app for modern society.</li>
							<br>
							<li><b>Pros and Cons of Open Source GIS software</b> -  in which I had to write an essay on open source vs closed source.</li>
							<br>
							<li><b>Everyone Likes Amsterdam</b> – in which we had to visualize a figure by collecting geo-data in Amsterdam.</li>
						</ol> 
					</p>
				</div>

		<div class="topheader"> <!-- GreenRoads app -->
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-12"><h2>GreenRoads app</h2></div>
			</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row paragraph">
				<div class="col-6">
					<p>One of the first assignments was to come up with a financially viable idea for a <b>smartphone app with GIS-integration</b>. Though we didn’t have to develop the app, we had to think everything through; it should be of added value for society, 
						(in)directly increasing the <i>Quality of Life</i>. Together with two fellow students, I came up with the idea of GreenRoads. This app would <b>calculate routes from A to B</b>, with options for traveling by car, bicycle, and foot, as well as several 
						public transport options. Just like any other popular route guidance app. 
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-6">
					<p>However, the renovating idea of this app would be to focus on emissions of greenhouse gasses; a user would be able to right away see the <b>environmental impact</b> of his/her travel. By choosing the <i>Greenest Road</i>, the user would collect tokens, 
						which could in turn be exchanged for <b>discount on green products</b>, like organic coffee, or for green actions, like planting a tree or adopting a penguin. Apart from these real-life rewards to collecting tokens, the process of collecting 
						the tokens (and of course medals/rewards along the way) should be <i>a reward on its own</i>, like with any other addictive ‘game’.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row paragraph final">
				<div class="col-6 center">
						<img src="css/images/GreenRoute-logo.png" alt="GreenRoute logo" style="width:80%;" align="center"><br><br>
						<p><i>The logo that we created for the GreenRoads app.</i></p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-6">
					<p>The <b>financial profit</b> should be found in deals with the organic product owners, who get a lot of <i>publicity and new customers</i> through giving a small discount based on tokens. These companies should pay a fee to join in on the app.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-6">
					<p>The <b>pitfall</b> of this idea is still how to check if the chosen route is also followed. Besides that, the main focus should be to give users insight in the different emission footprints per transportation method. Though other apps already give 
						insight in this, <i>GreenRoads</i> would give the possibility to store cars with specific preferences, so that the comparison would be more accurate.<br>

			<div class="row paragraph final">
				<div class="col-6">
					<p>Another assignment was to write an essay on the pros and cons of open source GIS software and -data.</p>
					<p><h4>“Open source software is software whose source code is available for modification or enhancement by anyone.”</h4><i> - OpenSource.com</i></p>
